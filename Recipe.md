first take the pan and put it on the stove let it sit at around heat level 5 for a few minutes

while its doing that take the eggs, milk, salt, and cheese and put it in a bowl

wisk the bowl for about 3-5 minutes

next take the butter and if the butter melts when it touches the pan its been long enough. 

Spread the butter on the pan

after take the bowl and pour the eggs in the pan

if the pan is too hot you will need the spatula to get the egg off the pan and push it together

if the pan is not low heat than you will need to shake the pan to get the eggs moving and cooking

after make sure you keep the eggs in one space

once they are less liquid like flip them and repeat this process for about 5 minutes 

put it on a plate and enjoy
